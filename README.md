# Android Interview

## Overview
Simple Android app that displays a list of images with descriptions. A fake repository is given and can be assumed to be working correctly.
Task is to add new features to the app and fix some defects

## Changes
- When scrolling down there is identified jank
- We would like to add a second "detail" screen that displays an image along with description
- The connection is slow, can we display a loader?
- There is reports of memory leak
- Can we display the images in a grid rather than vertical list
